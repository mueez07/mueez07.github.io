	  </div>
	</div>

	<p>The term, ‘architecture’, in terms of computers, refers to the manner in which various pieces of a the hardware interact. </p>
<!--  
	<p>There are essentially five components to usability:</p>

	<ul class="list-group">
  		<li class="list-group-item"><b>Learnability</b>
  			<p></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px"> Refers to ability of the user to accomplish primary tasks the first time they encounter the interface. </p> </li>

 		 <li class="list-group-item"><b>Efficiency</b>
  			<p></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px"> Refers to the speed at which users can accomplish primary tasks after they have learned and understood the design.</p> </li>

 		 <li class="list-group-item"><b>Memorability</b>
  			<p></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px"> Refers to the ability of the user to maintain the same level of skill using the interface after not encountering it for an extended period of time. </p> </li>

  		<li class="list-group-item"><b>Error</b>
  			<p></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px"> Refers to the number of errors that the user can potentially make when using the interface. It also refers to the severity of these errors and the easiness for the user to recover.</p> </li>

 		 <li class="list-group-item"><b>Satisfaction</b>
  			<p></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px"> Refers to the pleasure that the user feels while using the interface. Factors such as the aesthetics of the design can contribute to the user’s satisfaction. </p> </li>

	    <b>The three commonly used devices that will be examined are smart TV's, mobile phones, and laptops</b>
	  </div>
	</div>

	<ul class="list-group">
  		<li class="list-group-item"><b><font size="+2">Smart TV's</font></b>
  			<p></p>
  			Commonly found usability issues include:
  			<p></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 30px"> Labelling of icons located on the remote to be inconsistent with operations on the screen This affects the efficiency, error, and satisfaction of the design. Users will spend their time inefficiently figuring out which buttons to press. The inconsistent labelling might cause wrong buttons to be pressed by users, causing error. The use of the remote might not be a pleasant experience for users due to the confusing labelling of the buttons. </p> 
			<p style="margin-left: 30px"> Shape of remote itself can be uncomfortable to hold. This affects the efficiency and satisfaction of the design. With longer or shorter remotes, it might take longer for users to reach and press certain buttons located inconveniently on the remote. The user might also be in discomfort while holding the remote. </p> 
			<p style="margin-left: 30px"> Data entry operations using alphanumeric keyboards are difficult to complete. This affects the efficiency, error, and satisfaction of the design. It would take users longer amounts of time to enter data using the alphanumeric keyboards. Users may frequently commit errors while typing values using the keyboard. The texture of the keyboard might make it uncomfortable for the user to carry the remote. </p> 
			<img src="alphanumeric-keyboard.png" class="img-rounded" alt="alphanumeric-keyboard" width="304" height="236">
			<font size = "-1">This is an example of an alphanumeric keyboard</font>

		</li>

  		<li class="list-group-item"><b><font size="+2">Mobile Phones</font></b>
  			<p></p>
  			Commonly found usability issues include:
  			<p></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 30px">Small screens and keyboards. This affects learnability, efficiency, error, and satisfaction of the design. The small screens can make it harder for the user to see information on the screen or see how the device reacts to their actions, which would hinder the user’s ability to learn how to use the device. The small keyboards can slow down the user’s ability to input data. The small keyboard’s can also increase the chances for a user to press the wrong button or input wrong information, which would cause error. The user might have a hard time reading data from the small screen or reading labels on the small keyboard, which would negatively impact the user’s satisfaction with the design. </p> 
			<p style="margin-left: 30px"> Screens can sometimes be overloaded with information and content. This affects learnability, memorability, and satisfaction of the design. The user can have a hard time learning how the device reacts to their actions when they are unsure of which content on the screen is significant to them and which is not. When there is too much information on the screen, the user can have a hard time remembering what content they should pay attention to and what content they should ignore. The user may not find the design aesthetically appealing if there is too much information on the screen.  </p> 
			<p style="margin-left: 30px"> Textual input for the user is required where it is possible to arrange for default values or choices. This affects the efficiency and the error of the design. It will take longer for users to manually type and input data in to the device, causing inefficiency. When the user manually types the data, it increases the chances of the wrong button being pressed while typing, which causes error.  </p> 

		</li>


  		<li class="list-group-item"><b><font size="+2">Laptops</font></b>
  			<p></p>
  			Commonly found usability issues include:
  			<p></p>
			<p style="margin-left: 30px"> Harmful body posture is often maintained by users to interact with the interface. This often causes pain and discomfort in several areas of the body. This affects the satisfaction of the design. Users are put in great discomfort when interacting with the interface. </p> 
			<p style="margin-left: 30px"> It is more difficult for users to complete mathematical and logical calculations on a laptop. This affects the efficiency and the error of the design. Studies have shown that users will take longer to come up with mathematical and logical calculations while using a laptop as opposed to using a writing utensil on a flat surface. As the difficulty for the user to complete these calculations increases, the chances of error within the results also rises.  </p> 
			<p style="margin-left: 30px"> The laptop screen display has negative effects on the user’s eyes. This affects the satisfaction of the design. Users will be put in physical discomfort while using the device due to its effect on their eyes.  </p>
